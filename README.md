---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Common Interview Questions & Answers

**Q1:** *How does your authentication system work?*  
**A:** I use JWT-based authentication. On login, the server generates a signed token stored in the client‚Äôs local storage. Every API request includes this token in the header for verification.

**Q2:** *How do you handle payments securely?*  
**A:** I integrate with a payment gateway like Stripe, which handles sensitive card data. My backend only stores transaction IDs, not card details.

**Q3:** *How do you optimize product search?*  
**A:** By indexing product names and descriptions in the database and using pagination to limit results per request.

**Q4:** *What would you improve if given more time?*  
**A:** Add AI-powered product recommendations, implement microservices for scalability, and integrate Elasticsearch for faster search.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Improvements (to stand out in interviews)
- **Microservices Architecture** for scalability  
- **ElasticSearch** for advanced search  
- **Redis Caching** for faster product loading  
- **CI/CD Pipeline** for automated deployment  
- **Docker & Kubernetes** for containerized deployment  
- **Analytics Dashboard** for sales insights

## üõ† Project Title  
**Multi‚ÄëVendor E‚ÄëCommerce SaaS Platform** (Shopify‚Äëlike)  
Built with **Microservice Architecture**, **ImageKit**, **Stripe Connect**, **Kafka**, **Redis**, **Docker**, and **NX Monorepo**.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ My Role & Vision
> ‚ÄúI designed and developed a scalable, production‚Äëready multi‚Äëvendor e‚Äëcommerce SaaS platform from scratch, focusing on modular microservices, real‚Äëtime communication, and cloud‚Äëready deployment.‚Äù

**Key Goals I Set:**
- Handle multiple vendors with separate dashboards
- Support real‚Äëtime product updates & order tracking
- Integrate secure payments for multiple sellers
- Optimize media delivery with ImageKit
- Architect for scalability using microservices

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Architecture Decisions I Made

**Why Microservices?**  
I wanted independent, loosely coupled services so each could scale individually.  
Services I created:
- **Auth Service** ‚Äî User & seller authentication (JWT, OTP, password reset)
- **Product Service** ‚Äî Product CRUD, categories, discounts
- **Order Service** ‚Äî Order placement, tracking, status updates
- **Payment Service** ‚Äî Stripe Connect integration for multi‚Äëvendor payouts
- **Notification Service** ‚Äî Email/SMS alerts
- **API Gateway** ‚Äî Single entry point, request routing, authentication middleware

**Tech Stack:**
| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Frontend | React + TailwindCSS |
| Backend | Node.js + Express |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Prisma ORM) |
| Messaging | Kafka |
| Cache | Redis |
| Media | ImageKit |
| Deployment | Docker + AWS |
